Display icons for WordPress plugins

== Description ==

Almost every WordPress plugin has it's own Icon / Banner. You may realize that when you are searching for plugins or when you at a plugin's page on wordpress.org.
Icons can help you to understand what a plugin is about.

But it's not allowed to display icons once you install plugins.
It would be so handy to see them. They would help you to identify plugins quickier and at least they would turn that plugins list into something less boring, right?

Well, now you can display them.
Simply enable this plugin and you will see plugins icons on admin plugins page.

On **settings > Plugins icons**,
You can even play with some settings, like icon's size and the column position they will be displayed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire 'txtoit-icons-for-plugins' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Start by visiting plugin settings at Settings > Plugins Icons.
