**Icons for plugins** displays icons for WordPress plugins on the plugins list page, on admin

== Description ==

**Icons for plugins** displays icons for WordPress plugins on the plugins list page, on admin.

WordPress dashboard doesn't allow to display icons on admin plugins page (wp-admin/plugins.php).
It would be so handy to see them. They would help you identify plugins quickier and at least they would turn that plugins list into something less boring, right?

Well, now you can display icons for plugins on plugins list page, on dashboard.
Simply enable this plugin and you will see plugins icons on admin plugins page.

On **Settings > Plugins icons**, you can even play with some settings, like icon's size and the column position they will be displayed.
